After extracting the zip file, you will see a folder named "nullDC\_104\_r136". Inside this folder, you will find several files and subfolders, such as "data", "plugins" and "nulldc.exe". This is the main executable file that you need to run to launch the emulator.

The BIOS files are not included in the download package of NullDC 1.0.6 due to legal reasons. You need to find them on your own from other sources on the internet. Make sure you download the correct BIOS files for your region (USA, Europe or Japan).
 
Once you have downloaded the BIOS files, you need to copy them to the "data" subfolder inside the "nullDC\_104\_r136" folder. You should rename them as follows:

- "dc\_boot.bin" for the Dreamcast BIOS
- "dc\_flash.bin" for the Dreamcast flash memory
- "naomi\_boot.bin" for the NAOMI BIOS

After copying and renaming the BIOS files, you are ready to run the emulator.
